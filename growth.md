Within the article, I found it interesting when they mentioned that children that were praised for effort, sought new instruction.I feel that this class is built to build this mindset. I do not believe it to be reasonable to think that one can obtain 2 years worth of information in 12 weeks, without struggle and "failure". It is cliche, but failure is mindset. It really is something that happens when effort ceases.

I think this will help me immensely throughout this class. I have a tendancy to shy away from making mistakes and I have seen it hold it back. I have decided weeks ago however, to really work on letting the idea of looking stupid, go. It is fundamentally ridiculous to think that someone can learn something completely new and do it without, at least some, struggle. The main ingredient for success in this class will be work and I am supremely confident in myself when it comes to that.
